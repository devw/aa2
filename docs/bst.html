                        tree with height H is <var>2<sup>H</sup> â€” 1</var>.

                    <p>
                        A complete binary tree has all levels completely filled with nodes except the last level and in
                        the last level, all the nodes are as left side as possible. A complete binary tree is a tree
                        where every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled. The last level must be filled
                        from left to right. Therefore, you can create a complete binary tree of 20 nodes by filling each
                        level from left to right, until your tree has 20 nodes.

                <p>
                    The path length of a tree is a cost measure of great importance for the analysis of algorithms.

                    The average path length of a tree (with respect to a uniform probability distribution on the items
                    in the tree) is its path length (the sum of the lengths of the path from the root to each node in
                    the tree) divided by the number of nodes in the tree.

                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    The binary search tree (BST) is a variation of the binary tree in which: 1) elements in left subtree
                    are smaller than the elements in the current node, 2) elements in right subtree are greater than the
                    the elements in the current node.
                </p>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p>
                    There can be several BSTs representing the same set of data ( {6,8,10,11,14,16,18 ,30,33} ) as shown
                    in the following example.

                        the pointers (indexes) to the left and right nodes.
